# Managed Partitioned Array Changelog

## Last Updated
* 10/22/2022 - 3:30am
* VERSION v2.0.0-mpa (10/22/2022)

 NOTE: ManagedPartitionedArray and PartitionedArray have different versions. PartitionedArray can work along but
 ManagedPartitionedArray, while being the superset, depends on PartitionedArray
 `VERSION v2.0.0-mpa / v1.2.6-pa` - added more arguments to the archive! methods, since file partition contexts don't need to exactly meet with all the others
 `VERSION v1.3.2-mpa / v1.2.5a-pa` - save and load partition from disk now auto-saves all variables, since those always change often (10/21/2022 1:11PM)
 VERSION ManagedPartitionedArray/PartitionedArray - `v1.3.1release(MPA)/v1.2.5a(PA) (MPA-v1.3.1-rel_PA-v1.2.5a-rel)`
 - cleanup and release new version (10/19/2022 - 1:50PM)

 VERSION v1.3.0a - endless add implementation in ManagedPartitionedArray#endless_add
 Allows the database to continuously add and allocate, as if it were a plain PartitionedArray
 NOTE: consider the idea that adding a partition may mean that it saves all variables and everything to disk
 SUGGESTION: working this out by only saving by partition, and not by the whole database
 SUGGESTION: this would mean that the database would have to be loaded from the beginning, but that's not a big deal
 VERSION v1.2.9 - fixes
 VERSION v1.2.8 - Regression and bug found and fixed; too many guard clauses at `at_capacity?` method (10/1/2022)
 VERSION v1.2.7 - fixed more bugs with dynamic allocation
 VERSION v1.2.6 - bug fix with array allocation given that you don't want to create file partitions (9/27/2022 - 7:09AM)
 VERSION v1.2.5 - bug fixes
 VERSION: v1.1.4 - seemed to have sorted out the file issues... but still need to test it out
 VERSION: v1.1.3 
 many bug fixes; variables are now in sync with file i/o
 Stopped: problem with @latest_id not being set correctly
 working on load_from_archive! and how it will get the latest archive database and load up all the variables, only it seems
 that there is something wrong with that. 
 VERSION: v1.1.2 (9/13/2022 10:17 am)
 Prettified`
 Added raise to `ManagedPartitionedArray#at_capacity?` if `@has_capacity == false`
 VERSION: v1.1.1a - got rid of class variables, and things seem to be fully working now
 VERSION: v1.1.0a - fully functional, but not yet tested--test in the real world
 VERSION: v1.0.2 - more bug fixes, added a few more tests
 VERSION: v1.0.1 - bug fixes
 VERSION: v1.0.0a - fully functional at a basic level; can load archives and the max id of the archive is always available
 VERSION: v0.1.3 - file saving and other methods properly working
 VERSION: v0.1.2 - added managed databases, but need to add more logic to make it work fully
 VERSION: v0.1.1
UPDATE 8/31/2022: @latest_id increments correctly now


Manages the @last_entry variable, which tracks where the latest entry is, since PartitionedArray is dynamically allocated.


# Partitioned Array Changelog

## Version
v1.2.6-pa (10/22/2022)


VERSION: v1.2.6 - cleanup; plan on being able to save @data_arr to file directly (not by partitions) - 10/19/2022 2:03PM
VERSION v1.2.5a - endless add implementation in ManagedPartitionedArray#endless_add
Allows the database to continuously add and allocate, as if it were a plain PartitionedArray
VERSION v1.2.4 - now its not "data_arr_size" if you set the variable correctly
Note: The struct may require more work, but this struct in particular is not necessary in the managed partitioned array
-- too many allocations are done when 'at capacity', but its because of the nature of the beast
VERSION v1.2.4 - fixed a bug with allocations, also modified in ManagedPartitionedArray
VERSION v1.2.3 - fully functional in tandem with ManagedPartitionedArray; added a few more tests (9/13/2022 - 5:48am)
VERSION v1.2.2 - after adding partitions, every partition is saved to reflect the new changes on disk
VERSION v1.2.1 - fixed PartitionedArray#get(id, &block) bugs
                 - file cleanup
VERSION v1.2.0 - Cleanup according to rubocop and solargraph linter; clarification in places added (8/11/2022 - 6:01am)
VERSION v1.1.1 - Documenting code and scanning for bugs and any version wrap-ups
   -   v1.1.2 - PartitionedArray#add(return_added_element_id: true, &block): return element id of the location of the addition 
VERSION v1.1.0a (8/11/2022 - 5:11am)
-- PartitionedArray#add_partition now works correctly.
* Various bug fixes that lead to array variable inconsistencies


VERSION v1.0.5a (7/30/2022)
-- So far the partitioned array works with allocation of partitions, saving to files, and loading from files.
PROBLEM/BUG: PartitionedArray#add_partition does not allocate and manage the variables correctly
IT: upon the need to add a new partition, it adds but the entry is added to the end of the @data_arr
partition, extending its length by one which is not what we want.
VERSION v1.0.5 (7/30/2022)
More bug fixes, notable in saving and loading data from files.
Example:

partition0: [{"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World"}]
partition1: [{"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World"}, {"log"=>"Hello World", :log=>"Hello World"}]
partition2: [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]S
partition3: [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
partition4: [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]

partition0 is the length that the partitions should be in this case, p_1 had an entry appended to itself somehow, and 
PartitionedArray won't add any more entries to it, once it reaches its max and has an additional element added.

VERSION v1.0.4 (7/30/2022 9:37PM)
Various bug fixes and improvements.
PartitionedArray#load_from_files! now works without throwing nil entries.

VERSION v1.0.3 (7/30/2022 2:42PM)
Added ManagedPartitionedArray for CGMFS, which inherits from PartitionedArray and adds the following functionality:
- last_entry
=> last_entry is a variable that keeps track of the last entry that was added to the database, in terms of a @data_arr
since PartitionedArray is dynamically allocated, it is not possible to know the last entry that was added to the database

VERSION v1.0.2a
All necessary instance methods have been implemented, ready for real world testing...

Ranged binary search, for use in CGMFS
array_id = relative_id - db_size * (PARTITION_AMOUNT + 1)

When checking and adding, see if the index searched for in question

when starting out with the database project itself, check to see if the requested id is a member of something like rel_arr

1) allocate range_arr and get the DB running
2) allocate rel_arr based on range_arr
3) allocate the actual array (@data_arr)
VERSION: v1.0.2
VERSION: v1.0.1a - set_partition_subelement
VERSION: v1.0.0 - all essential functions implemented
5/9/20 - 5:54PM
TODO:
def save_partition_element_to_file!(partition_id, element_id, db_folder: @db_folder)

VERSION: v1.0.0 (2022/03/30 - 3:46PM)
Implemented all the necessary features for the PA to work, except for an add_from_lefr or add_from_right, which will
attempt to fill in the gaps in the database.
TODO: implement pure json parsing

* Notes: Have to manually convert all the string data to their proper data structure
* HURDLE: converting strings to their proper data structures is non-trivial; could check stackoverflow for a solution
VERSION v2.0 (4/22/2022) - added PartitionedArray#add(&block) function, to make additions to the array fast (fundamental method)
VERSION v0.6 (2022/03/30) - finished functions necessary for the partitioned array to be useful
VERSION: v0.5 (2022/03/14)
Implemented
PartitionedArray#get_part(partition_id) # => returns the partition specified by partition_id or nil if it doesn't exist
PartitionedArray#add_part(void) # => adds a partition to the array, bookkeeping is done in the process
VERSION: v0.4 (11:55PM)
Fixed bugs, fixed array_id; allocate and get are fully implemented and working correctly for sure
VERSION: v0.3 (3:46PM)
allocate and get(id) are seemingly fully implemented and working correctly
* start work on "allocate_file!"
VERSION: v0.2 (02.28/2022 3:10PM)
Currently working on get(id).
VERSION: v0.1 (12/9/2021 12:31AM)
Implementing allocate
SYNOPSIS: An array system that is partitioned at a lower level, but functions as an almost-normal array at the high level
DESCRIPTION:
This is a system that is designed to be used as a database, but also as a normal array.
NOTES:
When loading a JSON database file (*_db.json), the related @ arr variables need to be set to what is within the JSON file database.
This means the need to parse a file, and @allocated is set to true in the end.
